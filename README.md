## Introduction
The aim of the project is to generate programming language from formal specifications. </br>
The input text is a formal specification function (implicit) </br>
Output is a completing program which uses one of above-mentioned programming languages can execute. </br>

In the project, it can convert formal specification to C# and Java. </br>
This is the [Software Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QO5AZmznACN4H8sqZk6avHKcedXbSD4a/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116992013396456829835&rtpof=true&sd=true)
